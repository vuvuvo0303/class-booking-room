          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            When you use Face ID to book rooms at FPT University, we collect
            facial data to authenticate your identity. This data is securely
            encrypted and stored temporarily during the booking session. No
            facial data is retained after you have successfully booked a room.
          </p>

            2. Usage of Data
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Your facial data is used solely for authentication purposes. We do
            not share this data with any third parties. The data helps verify
            your identity to ensure that only authorized users can book rooms.

            We implement robust security measures, including encryption and
            secure servers, to protect your personal and facial data. In
            addition, all facial recognition operations happen locally on your
            device to ensure maximum security.
